### `Donate(options)`
Create the selection UI where the user can choose a fixed or a custom amount.

#### Params

- **Object** `options`: An object containing the following fields:
 - `prefix` (String): The snippet that should appear *before* the amount value (default: `""`). Could be useful for currencies (e.g. `"$"`).
 - `sufix` (String): The snippet that should appear *after* the amount value (default: `""`).
 - `onChange` (Function): The change handler called with: the amount value (Number), the amount element and the event object.
 - `format` (Function): The format handler which is used to format the amounts. Should return strings or values that can be stringified.
 - `itemAppended` (Function): The after-append handler.
 - `container` (String|Element): The donate.js container.
 - `amounts` (Array): An array of numbers representing the fixed amounts (e.g. `[5, 10, 50]`).
 - `classes`: An object to configure the classes:
   - `active` (String): The active class.
 - `custom` (Boolean|String): If `true`, then the custom amount input will appear. If it's a string, it will be interpreted as raw HTML (default: `false`).
 - `defaultValue` (Boolean|Number): The default value. If `true`, the first amount will be used as default amount.

#### Return

 - `active` (Element): The active element.
 - `ul` (Element): The `<ul>` list element created by the library.
 - `select` (Function): The select function (see below).

### `select(amount, value, e, isCustom)`

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
